The input consists of several test cases. Each test case starts with a line with four non-negative integers, 1 $\leq$ n $\leq$ 10000, 0 $\leq$ m $\leq$ 20000, 1 $\leq$ q $\leq$ 100 and 0 $\leq$ s < n, separated by single spaces, where 
 is the numbers of nodes in the graph, m the number of edges, q the number of queries and s the index of the starting node. Nodes are numbered from 0
 to n.
. Then follow 
 lines, each line consisting of five (space-separated) integers u, v, t_0, P and d, indicating that there is an edge from u
 to v
 in the graph which can be traversed at time t_0+t*p
 for all nonnegative integers t, and that it takes d
 time units to traverse the edge. You may assume 0 $\leq$ t_0, P, d $\leq$ 1000.

 For instance, the edge 3 8 15 10 5 indicates that at time 15, 25, 35, 45...
, we can travel from node 3 to node 8 in 5 time units. Note that it is possible to stand still at a node, to wait for an edge to become available. Also, note that if P=0 , the edge can be used only at time t_0 and never again.


Then follow q lines of queries, each consisting of a single non-negative integer, asking for the minimum distance from node s to the node number given on the query line.

Input will be terminated by a line containing four zeros, this line should not be processed.


## Output
For each query, output a single line containing the minimum time to reach the node queried, assuming we start in node s at time 5, or the word “Impossible” if there is no path from s to that node. For clarity, the sample output has a blank line between the output for different cases.
